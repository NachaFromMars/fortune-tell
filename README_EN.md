**Claude Code Skill** — Multi-system Fortune Telling Expert Panel

## Why This Exists

A single divination system is essentially one opinion. These four systems originate from different civilizations, different mathematical models, different philosophical assumptions — when they independently reach the same conclusion, that signal is far more credible than any single system alone.

Same idea as ensemble methods in ML: **multiple weak classifiers voting is more robust than one strong classifier.**

## Three Rules

**Rule 1: Assess answerability first.** Not every question fits every system. Given a question, the skill first determines which systems' theoretical frameworks actually cover it, and only invokes those. No forced answers.

**Rule 2: Majority agreement or silence.** Let N = number of applicable systems. A conclusion is only surfaced when ≥ N-1 systems agree. If 2 systems apply, both must agree; if 3 apply, at least 2 must agree. Below-threshold interpretations are discarded entirely — no "System A says X but System B disagrees" noise.

**Rule 3: Translate ancient to modern.** These systems were invented in agrarian societies. "Officer star under attack" doesn't mean you'll be demoted — it means your sense of authority, management capacity, and workplace standing are under pressure during this period. All readings are auto-mapped to modern context.
